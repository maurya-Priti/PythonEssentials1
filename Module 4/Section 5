Exceptions, Debuggung and Testing

Exception:
-used for rror handling
-errors are the events that cause unexpected termination of program
-if not handled properly, may result in bad user experience and even bad developer experience, as user might get frustated if program unexpectedly terminates.
-if there is possibility of getting errors in any part of code, use try-except block

Some common Errors:
ValueError
TypeError
AttributeError
SyntaxError
ZerodivisionError

As python is interpreted language, errors in thode part of the code will not be raised which do not undergo exceution paths.

To avoid such errors, unit testing and debugging is required

debugging- control the flow to program during its execution, identifying the state of variables, change their values on demand that is inspecting the variav=bles and their states

another debugging method is ruck duck debugging.
-talk to rubber duck by speaking , explain the code by speaking, you may eventually track bugs in code.
unit testing can done by using pyrhon module named - unittest
