\ 
use blackslash to indicate continuation of line of code

if x==10 or y==1 or \
c==9:
  return ...

It can be particularly useful when you have to deal with long lines of code and you'd like to improve code readability.
-increases code readability

Always make sure that there is no redundancy in the code.
-dont include unnecesary repititive code.

Factorial Program:


n=5
factorial=1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        factorial*=j
    print(i," ",factorial)
    factorial=1


Fibonacci Series:

def fib(n):
    if n < 1:
        return None
    if n < 3:
        return 1

    elem_1 = elem_2 = 1
    the_sum = 0
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        the_sum = elem_1 + elem_2
        elem_1, elem_2 = elem_2, the_sum
    return the_sum


for n in range(1, 10):  # testing
    print(n, "->", fib(n))



Recursion:
Function invokes itself
