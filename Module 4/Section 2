Scopes in Python

-Scope is part of code where a variable or any property is recongnizable.
-variable existing inside a function does not have scope iutside the function
-variable existing outside a function is accessible inside function also,excluding those have same variable name inside function.

Global keyword:
to refrain python from creating a new local variable of same name which is already defined outside a function, global keyword is used.

x=10 ---this is global variable
def function():
  global x  ------use global variable defined outside the finction, instead of creating a new variable in local scope
  x=100     -----global x is reassigned to 100

x=10 ---this is global variable
def function():
  x=100     -----new local variable x is created and assigned value as 100
