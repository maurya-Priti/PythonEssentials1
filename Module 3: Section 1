1. The comparison (otherwise known as relational) operators are used to compare values. The table below illustrates how the comparison operators work, assuming that x = 0, y = 1, and z = 0:

2. When you want to execute some code only if a certain condition is met, you can use a conditional statement:

    a single if statement
    a series of if statements
    an if-else statement 
    a series of if statements followed by an else, e.g.:
        Each if is tested separately. The body of else is executed if the last if is False.

The if-elif-else statement
    If the condition for if is False, the program checks the conditions of the subsequent elif blocks - the first elif block that is True is executed. If all the conditions are False, the else block will be executed.

Nested conditional statements
