1. Variables – data-shaped boxes
            - special "boxes" (or "containers" as we may call them) for that purpose, and these boxes are called variables 
            ‒ the name itself suggests that the content of these containers can be varied in (almost) any way.

    to give a name to a variable, you must follow some strict rules:

            -the name of the variable must be composed of upper-case or lower-case letters, digits, and the character _ (underscore)
            -the name of the variable must begin with a letter;
            -the underscore character is a letter;
            -upper- and lower-case letters are treated as different 
            -the name of the variable must not be any of Python's reserved words 

Note that the same restrictions apply to function names.
 
2. The PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code recommends the following naming convention for variables and functions in Python:

            -variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores to improve readability (e.g., var, my_variable)
            -function names follow the same convention as variable names (e.g., fun, my_function)
            -it's also possible to use mixed case (e.g., myVariable), but only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style, to retain backward compatibility with the adopted convention.

3. Keywords
            Take a look at the list of words that play a very special role in every Python program.
            
            ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
            
            They are called keywords or (more precisely) reserved keywords.
            They are reserved because you mustn't use them as names: neither for your variables, nor functions, nor any other named entities you want to create.
            
            The meaning of the reserved word is predefined, and mustn't be changed in any way.
            
            Python is case-sensitive, you can modify any of these words by changing the case of any letter, thus creating a new word, which is not reserved anymore.


A variable comes into existence as a result of assigning a value to it. Unlike in other languages, you don't need to declare it in any special way.
If you assign any value to a nonexistent variable, the variable will be automatically created. You don't need to do anything else.
The creation (in other words, its syntax) is extremely simple: just use the name of the desired variable, then the equal sign (=) and the value you want to put into the variable.
