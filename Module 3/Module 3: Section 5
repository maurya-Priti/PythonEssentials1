Bubble Sort Algorithm

Sorting can be done in two ways:
Increasing order
Decreasing order

Algorithm:
Check adjacent elements in list and swap them if required, 
continue checking and swapping elements till list is sorted,
use swapped variable to keep track of whether swapping is done or not, swapped =True
Initially assign swapped to value True:
Run loop till swapped is true; (while swapped:), i.e. while True
assign value of swapped to false inside for loop, and change swapped to True when swapping of elemets is done.
