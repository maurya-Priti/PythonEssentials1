Logic and Bit operations:

1. Computer Logic:
    Conjuction - and , combining two or more  conditions, all conditions must be fullfilled 
    Disjunction - or , combining two or more conditions, atleast one condition must be fullfilled

2. Python and logic:
    TO express these logics in python, logical operatots are used.
    -Conjuction: 'and' operator ('&')
    -Disjunction: 'or' operator ('|')

3. and operator: 
  -binary operator
  -lower priority than comparison operators

4. or operator
  -binary operator
  -priority lower than and operator

5. not operator:
  -unary operator
  -logical negation
  -highest priority, same as unary + ,-

6. Logical values- 0 ,1
-0: reset, False
-1: set, True

7. Bitwise Operators:
                      & (ampersand) ‒ bitwise conjunction;- both condition true for true result
                      | (bar) ‒ bitwise disjunction;- atleast one condition true for true result
                      ~ (tilde) ‒ bitwise negation;- if true then result is false, if false then result is true
                      ^ (caret) ‒ bitwise exclusive or (xor).- if both operand is identical then, result is false
