Python is Interpreted Language

Python Goals:
-easy and intuitive language
-open source
-understandable as plain english
-suitable for everydat tasks

Python rival
-Perl
-Ruby

When python is not used:
-in development of driver or graphic engine where implementation must be very close to low-level programming language (close-to-metal programming)
-applications for mobile devices

Python2 and Python3 are not compatible with each other, i.e. Python2 code cannot be run on Python3 run environment or vice-versa.
However, newer versions of Python3 are backwarrd compatible.

Python implementations
-implementation refers to program or environment, which supports execition of programs written in Python language.
-Cython is traditional implementation of Python, C programming language used to implement Python, (automatically translate Python code into C language code)
        -It is easily coded but execution may be time consuming.
-complex mathematical calculations can be done

Other versions of Python implementation:
Jython, Java implementation of Python
        -large and complex systems written in Java can be integrated with Python to make it flexible using Jython 
        -communicates with existing Java infrastructure 
        -follows only Python2 standards, no support for Python3.

PyPy, Python within Python
      -represents environment which is written in Python like language, RPython(restricted Python)
      -subset of Python
      -it is not interpreted, instead it is translated into C program and then executed separately.
      -useful when a new feature is to be tested.
      -tool for people developing Python
      -compatible with Python3
